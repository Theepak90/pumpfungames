# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Checklist - FIXED!

## ✅ **CRITICAL: Follow These Steps EXACTLY**

### **1. Upload to Netlify**
- [ ] Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
- [ ] Drag and drop the **ENTIRE** `frontend/` folder contents
- [ ] **DO NOT** upload the `frontend` folder itself - upload what's INSIDE it
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete

### **2. Set Environment Variables**
- [ ] In Netlify dashboard, go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
- [ ] Add these variables:
  ```
  VITE_BACKEND_URL = http://YOUR_EC2_IP:3000
  VITE_WS_URL = ws://YOUR_EC2_IP:3000/ws
  ```
- [ ] Replace `YOUR_EC2_IP` with your actual EC2 IP address

### **3. Verify Files Are Present**
After upload, you should see these files in Netlify:
- [ ] `index.html` (2.08 kB)
- [ ] `_redirects` (444 bytes) ← **CRITICAL FILE**
- [ ] `404.html` (updated)
- [ ] `assets/` folder with JS/CSS
- [ ] All images and audio files

### **4. Test Routes**
- [ ] **Home page**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/` ✅
- [ ] **Game route**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/game` ✅
- [ ] **Direct access**: Try typing `/game` in browser ✅

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **SPA Routing Issues:**
- ✅ **`_redirects` file** - Now properly configured for Netlify
- ✅ **`index.html`** - Enhanced SPA routing script
- ✅ **`404.html`** - Proper fallback handling
- ✅ **`netlify.toml`** - Simplified and optimized

### **Key Changes Made:**
1. **Simplified redirects** - Single catch-all rule
2. **Enhanced SPA script** - Handles direct URL access
3. **Proper 404 handling** - Redirects to root with path storage
4. **Cleaner configuration** - Removed redundant rules

## 🚨 **If Still Getting "Page Not Found"**

### **Check These:**
1. **`_redirects` file exists** in Netlify (check file list)
2. **File is at root level** (not in subfolder)
3. **No extra spaces** in redirect rules
4. **Environment variables** are set correctly

### **Common Issues:**
- ❌ Uploading `frontend/` folder instead of contents
- ❌ Missing `_redirects` file
- ❌ Wrong environment variable names
- ❌ Backend not running on EC2

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After following this checklist:
- ✅ **All routes work** (/, /game, /snake/*)
- ✅ **No more "Page not found" errors**
- ✅ **SPA routing works perfectly**
- ✅ **Game loads and functions normally**

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you still get errors:
1. Check Netlify deployment logs
2. Verify all files are uploaded
3. Confirm environment variables are set
4. Test backend is running on EC2
