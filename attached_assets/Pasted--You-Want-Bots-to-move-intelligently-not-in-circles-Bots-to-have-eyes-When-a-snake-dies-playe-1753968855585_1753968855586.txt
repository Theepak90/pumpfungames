âœ… You Want:
Bots to move intelligently (not in circles)

Bots to have eyes

When a snake dies (player or bot):

Drops orange food

Each piece is worth 10 mass

Number of pieces = mass / 10

Drops are spread along the dead snakeâ€™s path

âœ… Step-by-Step Implementation Instructions:
ðŸ§  1. Fix Bot Movement (No More Circles)
Bots need a random roaming + avoidance system, so they explore more realistically.

âœ… Suggested Movement Logic:
js
Copy
Edit
bot.targetAngle += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.2; // drift a little
bot.angle += (bot.targetAngle - bot.angle) * 0.05; // smooth turn
bot.x += Math.cos(bot.angle) * speed;
bot.y += Math.sin(bot.angle) * speed;
You can also change targetAngle every few seconds randomly for variation.

ðŸ‘€ 2. Give Bots Eyes
For each bot snake, render eyes on their head (same way as the player):

js
Copy
Edit
drawEyes(bot.headX, bot.headY, bot.angle);
Make sure eye position is calculated relative to the head and rotated using the snake's direction (angle).

ðŸ’€ 3. Death Drop Logic
When any snake dies (player or bot):

Drop Math.floor(snake.mass / 10) orange food particles
Spread them evenly along the snakeâ€™s body path

âœ… How to Drop Orange Food:
js
Copy
Edit
function dropDeathFood(snake) {
  const amount = Math.floor(snake.mass / 10);
  const segmentSpacing = Math.floor(snake.segments.length / amount);

  for (let i = 0; i < amount; i++) {
    const segIndex = i * segmentSpacing;
    const seg = snake.segments[segIndex];

    food.push({
      x: seg.x,
      y: seg.y,
      color: 'orange',
      value: 10,
      size: 6,
    });
  }
}
âœ… This drops food along the body, not in one clump.

âœ… Works for both bots and players â€” just call it in your onSnakeDeath(snake) function.

âœ… What to Tell Replit:
Update bot AI so bots wander realistically:

Randomly drift and change target angle every few seconds

Smooth turning and consistent speed

Add eyes to bots just like the player, based on the head position and direction

When a snake dies:

Drop mass / 10 orange food pieces

Distribute them evenly along the snakeâ€™s body

Each food piece is worth 10 mass

Make sure this works for both the player and AI snakes.
