🐛 Problem: Snake Body Only Updates Every Few Seconds
🔍 Cause:
You're only adding a new segment position to the trail when the head has moved >= SEGMENT_SPACING, but the spacing is probably set too high relative to the speed, or you're only pushing one segment every X seconds, not continuously.

✅ THE FIX: Update the segment trail based on time or distance properly
✅ Step-by-Step Fix for Replit AI:
Update the snake trail recording logic so the body updates smoothly and frequently, not just once every few seconds.

✅ Recommended Code (Fix Trail Update Frequency):
1. Use a distanceBuffer to accumulate movement:

js
Copy
Edit
let distanceBuffer = 0;
let lastSegment = { x: head.x, y: head.y };
2. In your game loop, each frame:

js
Copy
Edit
// Move head
const dx = Math.cos(currentAngle) * speed;
const dy = Math.sin(currentAngle) * speed;
head.x += dx;
head.y += dy;

// Track distance moved
distanceBuffer += Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

if (distanceBuffer >= SEGMENT_SPACING) {
  segmentTrail.unshift({ x: head.x, y: head.y });
  distanceBuffer = 0; // reset buffer
}
This ensures a new segment is placed roughly every SEGMENT_SPACING pixels, not every few seconds.

✅ Add this to keep segments consistent:
js
Copy
Edit
// Ensure trail isn't longer than needed
const maxSegments = Math.floor(totalMass / MASS_PER_SEGMENT);
if (segmentTrail.length > maxSegments) {
  segmentTrail.length = maxSegments;
}
✅ Draw the body using segmentTrail:
js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 1; i < segmentTrail.length; i++) {
  const seg = segmentTrail[i];
  drawSegment(seg.x, seg.y); // gradient circle
}
Draw the head separately at head.x, head.y like we did before.

✅ Final Instructions for Replit AI:
Fix the trail update logic:

Track distance moved each frame using a distanceBuffer.

When distanceBuffer >= SEGMENT_SPACING, push a new segment to the trail and reset the buffer.

This ensures the body follows the head smoothly and continuously — not every few seconds.

Set a maxSegments = totalMass / MASS_PER_SEGMENT to cap how many trail points are stored.
