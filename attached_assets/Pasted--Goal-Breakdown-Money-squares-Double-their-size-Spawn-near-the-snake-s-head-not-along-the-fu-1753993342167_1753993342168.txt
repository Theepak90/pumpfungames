✅ Goal Breakdown
💵 Money squares:

Double their size

Spawn near the snake’s head, not along the full body

💀 On death:

Drop regular food balls in the snake’s color

Drops equal to the snake's mass

🐍 Growth:

Snake now grows 1 segment per 2 mass (i.e., 1 mass = 0.5 segments)

🧠 Step-by-Step Implementation
🔷 1. 💵 Double-size green money squares near head
In your death function:
js
Copy
Edit
const dropMoneySquares = (snake) => {
  const squareValue = 0.2;
  const count = Math.floor(snake.money / squareValue);

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    spawnFood({
      x: snake.head.x + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 20,
      y: snake.head.y + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 20,
      value: squareValue,
      type: 'money',
      size: 20, // double the previous size (10x10 becomes 20x20)
    });
  }
  snake.money = 0;
};
And render like this:
js
Copy
Edit
if (food.type === 'money') {
  ctx.fillStyle = '#00ff00';
  ctx.fillRect(food.x - 10, food.y - 10, 20, 20);
}
🔴 2. Drop regular food (snake color) on death
In your death function:

js
Copy
Edit
const dropDeathFood = (snake) => {
  const count = Math.floor(snake.mass); // 1 food per mass

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    const seg = snake.segments[Math.floor(i / count * snake.segments.length)];

    spawnFood({
      x: seg.x + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 8,
      y: seg.y + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 8,
      value: 1,
      color: snake.color,
      type: 'mass',
    });
  }
};
In drawFood():

js
Copy
Edit
if (food.type === 'mass') {
  ctx.fillStyle = food.color || '#d55400';
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(food.x, food.y, 7, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fill();
}
📈 3. 1 mass = 0.5 segments
Change the logic where the snake gains length:

js
Copy
Edit
// Instead of 1 mass = 1 segment:
snake.growthRemaining += food.value * 0.5;
Then in your update loop:

js
Copy
Edit
while (snake.growthRemaining >= 1) {
  addSegmentToSnake(snake);
  snake.growthRemaining -= 1;
}
✅ What to Tell Replit
Make green money squares 20×20px instead of 10×10

They should spawn near the snake's head on death, not along the body

When a snake dies, drop regular mass food in the snake’s body color

The number of food balls dropped = snake's mass

Each mass = 0.5 segments (so snake gains 1 segment per 2 mass)

Regular food is still round, but money is a square
