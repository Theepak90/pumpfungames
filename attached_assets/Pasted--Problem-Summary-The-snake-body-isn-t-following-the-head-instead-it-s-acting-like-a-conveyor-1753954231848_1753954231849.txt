🐛 Problem Summary:
The snake body isn't "following" the head — instead, it's acting like a conveyor belt: a new segment is added in front and removed from the back immediately.

Too many segments at the start — makes the snake look fully grown right away.

✅ SOLUTION OVERVIEW
We need to:

✔️ 1. Use a trail of head positions (segmentTrail) to let the body drag behind the head — not just duplicate the head’s current position.
✔️ 2. Set the initial mass low, so you start with fewer body segments.
✅ PART 1: Make the Snake Body Follow Properly
🔧 Key Fix:
Each frame, you move the head and store its position into a trail. Each body segment renders from that trail, spaced out over time — no popping or pushing body segments every frame.

🧠 Fix the Movement and Trail System:
js
Copy
Edit
let segmentTrail = [];            // List of head positions over time
let distanceBuffer = 0;
const SEGMENT_SPACING = 20;
const SEGMENT_RADIUS = 10;
const MASS_PER_SEGMENT = 1;
let totalMass = 6;                // Example: start with 6 mass
js
Copy
Edit
function updateSnake() {
  // Move head
  head.x += Math.cos(currentAngle) * speed;
  head.y += Math.sin(currentAngle) * speed;

  // Add to trail when enough distance passed
  const last = segmentTrail[0] || { x: head.x, y: head.y };
  const dx = head.x - last.x;
  const dy = head.y - last.y;
  distanceBuffer += Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

  if (distanceBuffer >= SEGMENT_SPACING) {
    segmentTrail.unshift({ x: head.x, y: head.y });
    distanceBuffer = 0;
  }

  // Cap the trail length
  const segmentCount = Math.floor(totalMass / MASS_PER_SEGMENT);
  if (segmentTrail.length > segmentCount) {
    segmentTrail.length = segmentCount;
  }
}
✅ PART 2: Start With Fewer Segments
If before you had totalMass = 30, and that made the snake too long, try:

js
Copy
Edit
const START_MASS = 6;  // 80% less than 30
let totalMass = START_MASS;
This gives you:

js
Copy
Edit
Math.floor(totalMass / MASS_PER_SEGMENT) = 6 segments to draw
✅ PART 3: Rendering Snake Properly
js
Copy
Edit
function drawSnake() {
  // draw body segments (trail)
  for (let i = 1; i < segmentTrail.length; i++) {
    const seg = segmentTrail[i];

    const gradient = ctx.createRadialGradient(
      seg.x, seg.y, 0,
      seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS
    );
    gradient.addColorStop(0, "#ffbaba");
    gradient.addColorStop(1, "#d55400");

    ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    ctx.fill();
  }

  // draw head separately
  const headGradient = ctx.createRadialGradient(
    head.x, head.y, 0,
    head.x, head.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS
  );
  headGradient.addColorStop(0, "#ffffff");
  headGradient.addColorStop(1, "#d55400");

  ctx.fillStyle = headGradient;
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(head.x, head.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fill();

  drawEyes(head.x, head.y, currentAngle);
}
✅ Final Instructions for Replit AI:
Fix the snake movement so the body follows the head by recording its position over time into a segmentTrail. Don’t push or pop segments directly.

Only add a new trail point when the head has moved at least SEGMENT_SPACING distance.

Draw the head separately, not as part of the trail.

Start the snake with totalMass = 6 to begin with ~6 segments — 80% less than before.
