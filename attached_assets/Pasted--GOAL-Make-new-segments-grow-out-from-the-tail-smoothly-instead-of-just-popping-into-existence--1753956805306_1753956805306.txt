🐍 GOAL:
Make new segments grow out from the tail smoothly, instead of just popping into existence.

✅ HOW TO FIX THIS:
Right now, you're likely doing something like:

js
Copy
Edit
if (newMass > oldMass) {
  // Add one new segment at the front or somewhere else
  segmentTrail.unshift(newSegmentPosition);
}
But that causes the "pop-in" effect you're seeing.

✅ INSTEAD: Use a longer trail & let segments shift into view
Let the segmentTrail grow longer, but only reveal more of it gradually by adjusting how many visible segments are rendered.

✅ Step-by-step fix for Replit AI:
Update the snake growth logic so that new segments appear from the tail, not the middle or head.

🔧 1. Store the full movement history:
Keep doing this:

js
Copy
Edit
segmentTrail.unshift({ x: head.x, y: head.y });
🔧 2. Don’t spawn new segments directly.
Instead, use:

js
Copy
Edit
const segmentCount = Math.floor(totalMass / MASS_PER_SEGMENT);
visibleSegments = [];

let distanceSoFar = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < segmentTrail.length && visibleSegments.length < segmentCount; i++) {
  const current = segmentTrail[i];
  const next = segmentTrail[i + 1] || current;

  const dx = current.x - next.x;
  const dy = current.y - next.y;
  distanceSoFar += Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

  if (distanceSoFar >= visibleSegments.length * SEGMENT_SPACING) {
    visibleSegments.push(current);
  }
}
This means the trail always exists, but the number of visible segments depends on your current mass. As you gain mass, more of the trail becomes visible — like the tail is growing.

✅ Result:
New body segments don’t pop into place.

They appear to emerge from the tail smoothly, trailing behind as the snake moves.

The growth looks natural and continuous, just like Slither.io.

✅ Final Instructions for Replit AI:
When the snake gains mass, do not insert new segments manually.

Instead, increase totalMass, and let the existing segmentTrail feed the new body.

The visibleSegments array should be built dynamically by walking the segmentTrail and spacing out segments every SEGMENT_SPACING.

As totalMass increases, more trail segments become visible, which makes the tail appear to grow naturally.
