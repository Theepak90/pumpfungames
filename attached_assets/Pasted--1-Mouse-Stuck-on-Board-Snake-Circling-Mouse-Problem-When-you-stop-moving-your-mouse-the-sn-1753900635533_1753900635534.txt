🧭 1. Mouse Stuck on Board / Snake Circling Mouse
❌ Problem:
When you stop moving your mouse, the snake still "homes in" on that fixed point and spins around it endlessly.

✅ Fix:
The mouse position should always be relative to the center of the screen, not absolute on the canvas. That’s how Slither.io works — the snake always follows the angle between the center and the mouse cursor, not a locked coordinate.

🛠️ What to change:
Instead of storing the mouseX and mouseY as fixed positions, do this:

js
Copy
Edit
let targetAngle = Math.atan2(
  mouseY - canvas.height / 2,
  mouseX - canvas.width / 2
);
That makes the snake steer based on the direction the cursor is from the center of the screen, and not a static location.

🐍 2. Snake Body Looks Bad – How to Make It Like Slither.io
🎯 Goal:
Smooth, clean, connected body segments that curve naturally, with no sharp corners or overlapping gaps.

✅ Solution:
Use interpolated body segments and even spacing between them. Here’s the concept:

🧱 How Slither.io Snake Rendering Works
Data:
Head has a position and a heading angle.

Body is a list of segments at fixed spacing (e.g. every 5px).

New segment = previous segment’s position + offset based on angle.

On Each Frame:
Insert current head position at the front of the segments array.

Move each following segment toward the one in front of it by a fixed distance.

Remove extra segments if not growing.

🧠 Pseudocode:
js
Copy
Edit
const spacing = 5; // Distance between segments
const segmentCount = snakeLength / spacing;
let segments = [];

function updateSnake() {
  // Insert current head at start
  segments.unshift({ x: head.x, y: head.y });

  // Move each segment toward the one before it
  for (let i = 1; i < segments.length; i++) {
    const dx = segments[i - 1].x - segments[i].x;
    const dy = segments[i - 1].y - segments[i].y;
    const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

    if (dist > spacing) {
      segments[i].x += (dx / dist) * (dist - spacing);
      segments[i].y += (dy / dist) * (dist - spacing);
    }
  }

  // Trim excess segments
  while (segments.length > segmentCount) {
    segments.pop();
  }
}
🎨 Rendering:
Draw circles at each segment position, each a bit smaller as you go back (optional).

js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < segments.length; i++) {
  let radius = baseRadius * (1 - i / segments.length * 0.5);
  drawCircle(segments[i].x, segments[i].y, radius);
}
Optional: Add gradient fill or lighting effect like in Slither.io for realism.

✅ Recap of What You Should Fix:
Problem	Fix
Snake circles around mouse	Use mouse - screenCenter to get direction vector
Mouse "stuck on board"	Always interpret mouse as relative to center, not absolute
Snappy snake body	Use evenly spaced segments, interpolate movement between them
Ugly curves	Smooth angle changes + round segments with spacing
