ðŸ”Ž PROBLEM SUMMARY:
Your current draw logic splits the rendering into:

drawBodyOnly for older segments (likely head to tail)

drawWithOutline for newer ones (tail to head)

But that means the back segment gets drawn last and appears on top â€” without an outline â€” hence it looks disconnected.

âœ… GOAL:
Fix rendering order and outline logic so:

Each segment is drawn in the correct visual stack (tail to head).

The last few segments (near head) get the outline.

Tail and mid segments do not draw outlines and appear below.

Head is always drawn last and has outline + eyes.

âœ… FIX STRATEGY:
âœ… Step-by-step for Replit AI:
Fix the segment drawing logic so that:

All segments are drawn in tail to head order.

The last N segments (e.g. 5) get outlines.

The very last segment (the head) is always drawn last, with outline and eyes.

âœ… Final Drawing Loop Structure:
js
Copy
Edit
const overlapHighlightCount = 5;
const lastIndex = visibleSegments.length - 1;

for (let i = 0; i <= lastIndex; i++) {
  const seg = visibleSegments[i];
  const isRecent = i >= lastIndex - overlapHighlightCount;
  const isHead = i === lastIndex;

  if (isRecent || isHead) {
    drawWithOutline(seg);
  } else {
    drawBodyOnly(seg);
  }
}
Then:

ðŸ§± drawBodyOnly() and drawWithOutline() stay the same:
js
Copy
Edit
function drawBodyOnly(seg) {
  const gradient = ctx.createRadialGradient(seg.x, seg.y, 0, seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS);
  gradient.addColorStop(0, "#ffbaba");
  gradient.addColorStop(1, "#d55400");

  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
  ctx.fill();
}

function drawWithOutline(seg) {
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS + 2, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fillStyle = "white";
  ctx.fill();

  drawBodyOnly(seg);
}
âœ… Summary for Replit AI:
Always render segments in order from tail to head.

Only apply outlines to the last 5 segments (or whatever number you choose).

Always draw the head last, with full outline and eyes.

This ensures the tail and body have clean overlap and the head sits clearly on top.

Let me know if you want this logic turned into a full drawSnake() function or if you'd like outline thickness or glow effects next!
