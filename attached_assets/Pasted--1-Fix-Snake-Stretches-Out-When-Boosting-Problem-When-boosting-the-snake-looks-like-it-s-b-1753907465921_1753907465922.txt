🧵 1. Fix: Snake “Stretches Out” When Boosting
❌ Problem:
When boosting, the snake looks like it’s being pulled — segments spread apart.

🎯 Cause:
You're likely increasing the head’s speed, but the tail isn't keeping up — no extra segments are added to match the faster movement.

✅ Fix:
When boosting, temporarily increase the density of body segments by skipping fewer pop() calls, or by inserting additional positions between updates.

🧠 Option 1: Insert extra segment points when boosting
In your game loop:

js
Copy
Edit
if (isBoosting) {
  // Insert more than one head segment per frame to keep it dense
  segments.unshift({ x: head.x, y: head.y }); // once...
  segments.unshift({ x: head.x, y: head.y }); // ...again
} else {
  segments.unshift({ x: head.x, y: head.y });
}
🧠 Option 2: Reduce segment spacing while boosting
If you use a segmentSpacing variable (say 4 or 5 px), shrink it while boosting:

js
Copy
Edit
let segmentSpacing = isBoosting ? 3 : 5;
This keeps the body tightly packed, even when moving faster.

👀 2. Fix: Eyes Should Follow Snake’s Movement, Not the Mouse
❌ Problem:
Eyes currently point toward the mouse, which breaks realism when you stop moving the mouse.

✅ Fix:
Make eyes follow the snake’s movement direction — use currentAngle, which you're already using to move the head.

🎯 Updated Eye Drawing:
js
Copy
Edit
let eyeOffsetX = Math.cos(currentAngle) * 4;
let eyeOffsetY = Math.sin(currentAngle) * 4;

// Eye positions (offset left/right slightly)
let leftEyeX = head.x + Math.cos(currentAngle + 0.5) * 5;
let leftEyeY = head.y + Math.sin(currentAngle + 0.5) * 5;

let rightEyeX = head.x + Math.cos(currentAngle - 0.5) * 5;
let rightEyeY = head.y + Math.sin(currentAngle - 0.5) * 5;

// Draw eyes
ctx.fillStyle = "white";
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(leftEyeX, leftEyeY, 3, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
ctx.fill();

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(rightEyeX, rightEyeY, 3, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
ctx.fill();

// Pupils pointing in movement direction
ctx.fillStyle = "black";
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(leftEyeX + eyeOffsetX, leftEyeY + eyeOffsetY, 1, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
ctx.fill();

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(rightEyeX + eyeOffsetX, rightEyeY + eyeOffsetY, 1, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
ctx.fill();
Now the eyes follow wherever the snake is going, not where the mouse is.

🧠 Final Instructions for Replit AI:
Fix the snake stretching when boosting by either:

Inserting additional head segments per frame while boosting, OR

Decreasing segmentSpacing when boosting to keep the body dense.

Make the eyes follow the snake’s movement direction, not the mouse.

Use currentAngle (the angle the head is moving) to offset the pupils.

This way, eyes look ahead in the direction of movement.
