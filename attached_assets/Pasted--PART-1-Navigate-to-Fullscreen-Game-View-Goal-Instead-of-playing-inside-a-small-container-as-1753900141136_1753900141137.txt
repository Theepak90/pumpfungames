🧭 PART 1: Navigate to Fullscreen Game View
🎯 Goal:
Instead of playing inside a small container (as shown), clicking “Play” or starting the game should:

Open the same game view but in a clean fullscreen route/view (like /game or /play).

✅ How to Do It:
Set up client-side routing (using React Router or similar).

Create a separate GamePage or FullScreenGame component.

When user clicks play/start, redirect to /game route.

Example (React Router):
jsx
Copy
Edit
<Route path="/game" element={<GameCanvasFull />} />
Then from your lobby/menu:

js
Copy
Edit
navigate("/game");
CSS Fix:
In your /game component:

css
Copy
Edit
html, body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}
canvas {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  display: block;
}
🐍 PART 2: Make Snake Turning Less Snappy (Smooth Slither-style Turning)
🎯 Goal:
In real Slither.io, the snake cannot instantly turn. Instead, it turns smoothly in an arc toward the cursor.

✅ How to Do It:
Use angle interpolation instead of instantly rotating to the mouse.

🧠 Step-by-step Implementation:
js
Copy
Edit
let currentAngle = 0;
let turnSpeed = 0.05; // Lower is smoother
On every frame:

js
Copy
Edit
let dx = mouseX - head.x;
let dy = mouseY - head.y;
let targetAngle = Math.atan2(dy, dx);

// Interpolate angle toward target
let angleDiff = targetAngle - currentAngle;

// Normalize angle difference to [-PI, PI]
if (angleDiff > Math.PI) angleDiff -= 2 * Math.PI;
if (angleDiff < -Math.PI) angleDiff += 2 * Math.PI;

// Apply smoothing
currentAngle += angleDiff * turnSpeed;

// Update head position using new angle
head.x += speed * Math.cos(currentAngle);
head.y += speed * Math.sin(currentAngle);
This makes the snake turn in wide arcs and prevents instant 180s—just like in the real game.

✅ Final Suggestions
✅ Use /game or /play route for fullscreen mode.

✅ Use requestFullscreen() if you want actual fullscreen API, or just simulate with layout.

✅ Replace direct mouse movement with smooth turning angle.

✅ Prevent U-turns instantly with angle interpolation.
