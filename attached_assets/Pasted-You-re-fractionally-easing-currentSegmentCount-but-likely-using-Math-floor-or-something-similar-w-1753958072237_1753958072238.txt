You're fractionally easing currentSegmentCount, but likely using Math.floor() or something similar when rendering segments â€” which causes the last tail segment to flicker as the count hovers near an integer.

Letâ€™s fix this cleanly.

âœ… Final Smooth Growth/Loss Fix (No Flickering):
Weâ€™ll do this in two parts:

ðŸ”§ PART 1: Use an integer renderSegmentCount, but round once per frame
Instead of re-calculating how many segments to show during interpolation, round once and stick with that number.

js
Copy
Edit
let currentSegmentCount = INITIAL_SEGMENT_COUNT;

function updateSegmentCount() {
  const target = Math.floor(totalMass / MASS_PER_SEGMENT);
  if (currentSegmentCount < target) {
    currentSegmentCount += 0.2; // smooth grow
  } else if (currentSegmentCount > target) {
    currentSegmentCount -= 0.2; // smooth shrink
  }
}
âœ… currentSegmentCount is a float.

ðŸ”§ PART 2: Interpolate exactly the number of segments from the trail
js
Copy
Edit
const renderSegmentCount = Math.round(currentSegmentCount);
const visibleSegments = getInterpolatedSegments(segmentTrail, renderSegmentCount);
You only round once â€” not inside your loop.

ðŸ”§ PART 3: Add logic to getInterpolatedSegments that avoids flickering:
Ensure your interpolation loop:

Samples consistent spacing

Never skips or duplicates the same point when segmentCount changes by 1

âœ… This ensures that one segment is added or removed only after enough easing distance, not by rapidly toggling around the threshold.

âœ… Final Instructions for Replit AI:
Fix segment flickering and choppy growth/shrink by implementing smooth easing of segment count:

Use a currentSegmentCount (float) that eases toward targetSegmentCount (based on mass).

Only Math.round(currentSegmentCount) once per frame and pass that value to your segment rendering logic.

Do not allow segment count to toggle back and forth each frame. This avoids flickering at the tail.

Ensure new segments appear naturally by extending the tail only when the currentSegmentCount crosses an integer boundary.
