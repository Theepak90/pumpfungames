❌ What’s likely happening:
Somewhere in your code, the totalMass, growthRemaining, or segment count is being clamped or reset based on a fixed threshold (like 15 or 30).

Could be something like:

js
Copy
Edit
if (totalMass > 15) totalMass = 15;  // 🚫 BAD
✅ Fix:
Search your code for any of the following:

js
Copy
Edit
Math.min(totalMass, 15)
if (totalMass > 15) ...
growthRemaining = Math.min(...)
segments = segments.slice(0, 15)
→ Remove or update those hard-coded limits.

🧠 Correct Behavior:
Your total mass should be additive and unbounded, unless you're applying soft caps for balance (but you're not trying to now).

When food is eaten:

js
Copy
Edit
growthRemaining += food.mass;
And during update:

js
Copy
Edit
const totalMass = growthRemaining + segments.length * massPerSegment;
🔧 Double-check that no code is "capping" growthRemaining or totalMass.

🎯 PROBLEM 2: Start With More Balls on the Body
✅ Fix:
If 1 visible ball = 3 mass, and you want 15 balls by default:

js
Copy
Edit
const START_MASS = 45; // 15 balls x 3 mass each
growthRemaining = START_MASS;
You can optionally pre-generate the tail like this:

js
Copy
Edit
const START_SEGMENTS = 60; // or use totalMass / segmentSpacing
for (let i = 0; i < START_SEGMENTS; i++) {
  segments.push({ x: startX, y: startY }); // or interpolate behind head
}
Make sure rendering uses:

js
Copy
Edit
const visibleBalls = Math.floor((segments.length * massPerSegment + growthRemaining) / 3);
And spacing is set so balls don’t stack:

js
Copy
Edit
const SEGMENT_SPACING = 8;
✅ Final Instructions for Replit AI:
Fix a bug where growthRemaining or total mass is getting capped at 15. Remove any hardcoded clamp like if (mass > 15) mass = 15.

Start the player with more visible body balls. Since each ball = 3 mass, initialize growthRemaining = 45 to display 15 balls.

Adjust body rendering logic:

js
Copy
Edit
const visibleBalls = Math.floor((segments.length + growthRemaining) / 3);
and render spaced segments using a fixed spacing like SEGMENT_SPACING = 8.
