❌ Problem:
The snake grows infinitely, even when not eating.

The tail doesn't follow the head, making it look stretched or uncoordinated.

The game isn’t fullscreen.

🐍 1. Fix: Snake Growing Without Eating
You're likely adding segments every frame, even without eating food.

✅ Correct behavior:

Only grow when food is collected.

Otherwise, maintain a fixed number of segments (e.g., 100 by default).

🛠️ Code Fix (Pseudocode):

js
Copy
Edit
// In Snake update loop:
if (!eatingFood) {
  // Remove the last segment to simulate movement
  snake.segments.pop();
}
// Add a new head position in the front
snake.segments.unshift(newHeadPosition);
When food is eaten:

js
Copy
Edit
function eatFood() {
  // Don't pop the last segment, snake "grows"
  // Just unshift new head as usual
}
🧠 2. Fix: Tail Not Following Head Smoothly
Your tail is probably just "dragged" or stuck because you're not simulating movement.

✅ Correct approach:

Treat each body segment as following the previous one.

🛠️ Basic Strategy:

Use an array segments, each segment is a coordinate {x, y}

On each frame:

Calculate new head position.

Insert it at the beginning: segments.unshift(newHead)

If not growing: remove last segment: segments.pop()

This makes the body "flow" behind the head.

🖥️ 3. Fix: Make Canvas Fullscreen
✅ In your HTML and JavaScript:

HTML:

html
Copy
Edit
<canvas id="gameCanvas"></canvas>
CSS:

css
Copy
Edit
body, html {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}
canvas {
  display: block;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
JavaScript:

js
Copy
Edit
const canvas = document.getElementById("gameCanvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

function resizeCanvas() {
  canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
  canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
}
window.addEventListener("resize", resizeCanvas);
resizeCanvas(); // call once on start
🎁 Bonus: Eye Fix Tip
If you want the eyes to always look at the mouse:

js
Copy
Edit
let angle = Math.atan2(mouseY - headY, mouseX - headX);
// use this angle to offset pupils in that direction
