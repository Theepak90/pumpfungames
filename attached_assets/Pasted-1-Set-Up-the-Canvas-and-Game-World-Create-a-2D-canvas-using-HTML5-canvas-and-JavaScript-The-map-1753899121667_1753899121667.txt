1. Set Up the Canvas and Game World
Create a 2D canvas using HTML5 <canvas> and JavaScript.

The map should be larger than the viewport, and the camera should follow the snake’s head.

Use a coordinate system where the snake moves, and the map scrolls accordingly.

2. Snake Object
Create a Snake class or object with:

segments: an array of x, y positions for the body

length: number of segments (increases with food)

speed: constant speed

direction: vector pointing from the head toward the mouse

radius: controls the thickness of the snake

3. Continuous Movement Toward Mouse
On every animation frame:

Get mouse coordinates relative to the canvas center.

Calculate the direction vector from the snake’s head to the mouse.

Normalize it and scale it by speed.

Add that vector to the head position.

Shift the segments forward so the body follows the head.

4. Mouse Tracking for Direction
Use mousemove event to track the mouse position.

Update a global targetMouse variable with x and y.

Always move the snake’s head toward this target.

js
Copy
Edit
canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
  targetMouse.x = e.clientX;
  targetMouse.y = e.clientY;
});
5. Map Boundaries (Death Barrier)
Define a rectangular map boundary, e.g., 4000x4000 pixels.

If the snake’s head goes outside the map area:

Trigger a death condition (e.g., reset game, display message).

js
Copy
Edit
if (head.x < 0 || head.x > mapWidth || head.y < 0 || head.y > mapHeight) {
  gameOver();
}
6. Food Balls
Create multiple food objects with x, y, and size.

Randomly place them across the map.

If the snake’s head is within a certain distance of a food ball:

Remove the food

Add segments to the snake (e.g., +5)

Optionally: play sound or animation

js
Copy
Edit
if (distance(snakeHead, food) < eatDistance) {
  growSnake(5);
  removeFood(i);
}
7. Snake Growth Logic
When growing, add segments behind the last segment.

Keep drawing the entire body using the segment array.

8. Camera Follow Snake
Translate the canvas so the snake's head is always in the center of the screen.

js
Copy
Edit
context.translate(canvas.width/2 - snakeHead.x, canvas.height/2 - snakeHead.y);
9. Eyes That Follow Mouse
On the snake’s head, draw two white circles for eyes.

Use Math.atan2 to calculate the angle between the head and the mouse.

Offset black pupils in that angle’s direction to create a “looking” effect.

js
Copy
Edit
let angle = Math.atan2(mouseY - head.y, mouseX - head.x);
let eyeOffset = 5;
drawCircle(head.x + eyeOffset * Math.cos(angle),
           head.y + eyeOffset * Math.sin(angle), pupilSize);
10. Game Loop
Use requestAnimationFrame() to continuously update:

Snake movement

Collision detection

Food collection

Redrawing canvas
