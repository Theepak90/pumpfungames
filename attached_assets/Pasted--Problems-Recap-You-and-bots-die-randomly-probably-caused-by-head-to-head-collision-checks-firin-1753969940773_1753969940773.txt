❌ Problems Recap:
You and bots die randomly → probably caused by head-to-head collision checks firing too often or imprecisely.

You can go through a snake's body → means body collision checks aren’t working.

Snakes die when touching each other's heads only → bad collision region setup.

✅ What You Want (Just Like Slither.io):
A snake only dies if its head hits another snake's body.

Head-to-head collisions do NOT kill both (unless you want that).

No false positives — no "random" deaths.

✅ Step-by-Step FIX
✅ 1. Snake Head Should Only Check Against Other Snakes’ Bodies, Not Heads
Here’s the correct collision logic:

js
Copy
Edit
function checkSnakeCollisions(snakes) {
  for (let i = 0; i < snakes.length; i++) {
    const snakeA = snakes[i];
    if (snakeA.isDead) continue;

    const head = snakeA.segments[snakeA.segments.length - 1]; // head

    for (let j = 0; j < snakes.length; j++) {
      if (i === j) continue; // skip self
      const snakeB = snakes[j];
      if (snakeB.isDead) continue;

      // Check head of A against BODY of B
      for (let k = 0; k < snakeB.segments.length - 10; k++) {
        const seg = snakeB.segments[k];
        const dx = head.x - seg.x;
        const dy = head.y - seg.y;
        const dist = Math.hypot(dx, dy);

        if (dist < segmentRadius) {
          // HEAD of A hit BODY of B → A dies
          killSnake(snakeA);
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
✅ We skip the last 10 segments so the head doesn’t check against its own front or the other snake's head.
✅ We don’t check head-to-head, to avoid false kills.

✅ 2. In killSnake(), add a flag so it only kills once:
js
Copy
Edit
function killSnake(snake) {
  if (snake.isDead) return;
  snake.isDead = true;
  dropDeathFood(snake);
  // remove from array, or set visible = false
}
✅ 3. Fix False Positives
If you’re getting random deaths:

You might be comparing head to head, which is wrong

You might be checking against your own body (don’t do that)

Or your segmentRadius is too large

✅ What to Tell Replit:
Fix snake collision logic so that:

A snake only dies if its head touches another snake’s body

Do not kill on head-to-head collision

When checking for collisions, skip the last 10 segments of the other snake to avoid false positives

Make sure the player can’t run through bot bodies, and bots can’t go through player or each other

Add an isDead flag to prevent repeated death processing
