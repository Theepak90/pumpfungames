✅ 1. Fix: Snake Grows Too Much Too Fast
❌ Problem:
Each food orb adds too many segments (growthRemaining += 10 or more), which makes the snake grow too quickly and feel “fake.”

✅ Solution:
Scale growth based on food size, and reduce the per-orb growth value to make it feel like Slither.io.

🧠 Ideal Growth Logic:
js
Copy
Edit
function eatFood(food) {
  const growthPerFood = Math.floor(food.size / 2); // Less dramatic
  growthRemaining += growthPerFood;
  score += growthPerFood;
  removeFood(food);
}
Use Math.floor(food.size / 2) or just a constant like growthRemaining += 2 for simpler control.

✅ 2. Fix: Snake Turns Too Sharply or Spins Weirdly
❌ Problem:
Snake still does instant turns when angle flips (especially when crossing 180°).

Sharp turns cause unrealistic spins, breaking player control.

✅ Smooth Turning Like Slither.io
You already use angle smoothing, but here's the robust fix that avoids all random flips or jittering:

🧠 Clean Smooth Turning Code:
js
Copy
Edit
let currentAngle = 0;
let turnSpeed = 0.05; // Smaller = smoother (try 0.03–0.07)

function updateAngleToMouse(mouseX, mouseY) {
  const dx = mouseX - canvas.width / 2;
  const dy = mouseY - canvas.height / 2;
  let targetAngle = Math.atan2(dy, dx);

  // Normalize angle difference to [-PI, PI]
  let angleDiff = targetAngle - currentAngle;
  while (angleDiff > Math.PI) angleDiff -= 2 * Math.PI;
  while (angleDiff < -Math.PI) angleDiff += 2 * Math.PI;

  // Smooth the turn
  currentAngle += angleDiff * turnSpeed;

  // Keep currentAngle in range
  if (currentAngle > Math.PI) currentAngle -= 2 * Math.PI;
  if (currentAngle < -Math.PI) currentAngle += 2 * Math.PI;
}
Then update the snake's head position using this smooth angle:

js
Copy
Edit
head.x += speed * Math.cos(currentAngle);
head.y += speed * Math.sin(currentAngle);
🔁 Result:
✅ Snake cannot do instant 180s.

✅ Turning is fluid and predictable.

✅ Players can make controlled loops without the snake "snapping" or flipping directions.

🧠 Final Replit AI Instructions:
“Fix the snake’s turn logic so that it uses Math.atan2() to get the angle toward the mouse relative to the center of the screen, and then gradually rotates the snake’s direction toward that angle using interpolation (not instant jumps). Clamp the angle difference to [-PI, PI] to prevent 180° flips. Also, reduce growth per food orb to 1–2 segments max, based on orb size.”
