🧠 What You Want:
✅ White outline always renders behind each individual body segment normally.

✅ BUT: When the snake crosses over itself, that segment’s white outline appears on top of the previous segments.

This is a conditional depth-based rendering effect, which isn't supported directly by Canvas z-index. But we can fake it — effectively.

🎯 GOAL:
Simulate Slither.io-style "outline above on self-overlap" effect:

Head & recent segments appear above older segments (including their outline).

Older segments are fully underneath.

✅ SOLUTION (Layered Drawing Trick):
✔️ Step-by-step plan:
Split your draw loop into two passes:

First: draw older segments with no outlines

Second: draw newer segments (near head) with outline + body

Pick a cutoff point like:

js
Copy
Edit
const overlapHighlightCount = 5; // last 5 segments (tail to head) get outline drawn above
✅ Instructions for Replit AI:
Make the white outline render behind the body except for the last few segments near the head (which render fully on top).

Here's how:

Split your segment rendering loop into two parts:

A. Draw older segments (tail to mid-body) without outlines:

js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < visibleSegments.length - overlapHighlightCount; i++) {
  const seg = visibleSegments[i];
  drawBodyOnly(seg); // no outline
}
B. Draw newer segments (overlapping/head area) with both outline + body:

js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = visibleSegments.length - overlapHighlightCount; i < visibleSegments.length; i++) {
  const seg = visibleSegments[i];
  drawWithOutline(seg); // outline first, then body
}
✅ Example drawBodyOnly() and drawWithOutline():
js
Copy
Edit
function drawBodyOnly(seg) {
  const gradient = ctx.createRadialGradient(seg.x, seg.y, 0, seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS);
  gradient.addColorStop(0, "#ffbaba");
  gradient.addColorStop(1, "#d55400");

  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
  ctx.fill();
}

function drawWithOutline(seg) {
  // White outline
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS + 2, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fillStyle = "white";
  ctx.fill();

  drawBodyOnly(seg);
}
🧠 Why This Works:
Segments closer to the head draw last → appear above earlier parts.

Their white outline is also on top → creates the illusion of 3D stacking, like Slither.io.

✅ Summary for Replit AI:
Split segment rendering into two passes:

First draw older segments without outlines

Then draw last N segments (near head) with white outlines

This makes the snake’s head and coils appear correctly layered on top of itself, with outlines behaving naturally.
