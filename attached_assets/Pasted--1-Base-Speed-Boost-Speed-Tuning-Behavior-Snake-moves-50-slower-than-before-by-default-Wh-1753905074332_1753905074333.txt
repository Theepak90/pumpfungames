✅ 1. Base Speed & Boost Speed Tuning
🎯 Behavior:
Snake moves 50% slower than before by default.

When boosting, moves 50% faster than base.

🛠️ Code Fix:
js
Copy
Edit
const BASE_SPEED = 1.5;          // 50% of original speed
const BOOST_MULTIPLIER = 1.5;
let speed = BASE_SPEED;

if (isBoosting) {
  speed = BASE_SPEED * BOOST_MULTIPLIER;
} else {
  speed = BASE_SPEED;
}
✅ 2. Boost Droplets = -0.2 Mass + Drop Food Worth 0.2
🎯 Behavior:
Each frame while boosting:

Lose 0.2 mass (i.e. 0.2 segment of length).

Drop a food orb worth exactly 0.2 at the tail position.

🛠️ Code Logic:
js
Copy
Edit
const BOOST_MASS_LOSS = 0.2;

if (isBoosting && segments.length > 10) {
  boostCooldown++;

  // Drop food every few frames (e.g. every 5)
  if (boostCooldown % 5 === 0) {
    const tail = segments[segments.length - 1];
    food.push({
      x: tail.x,
      y: tail.y,
      size: 3,
      mass: 0.2,
      color: "#f55400"
    });
  }

  // Mass loss
  for (let i = 0; i < BOOST_MASS_LOSS; i++) {
    if (growthRemaining > 0) growthRemaining--;
    else segments.pop();
  }
}
✅ 3. Map Food Mass Balancing
🎯 Behavior:
Big food = 2 mass

Medium = 1 mass

Small = 0.5 mass

🛠️ Food Spawn Example:
js
Copy
Edit
function spawnFood(type) {
  let food = {
    x: randX(),
    y: randY(),
    color: chooseColor(),
  };

  if (type === "big") {
    food.mass = 2;
    food.size = 10;
  } else if (type === "medium") {
    food.mass = 1;
    food.size = 6;
  } else {
    food.mass = 0.5;
    food.size = 4;
  }

  foodList.push(food);
}
Then when you eat:

js
Copy
Edit
growthRemaining += food.mass;
score += food.mass;
✅ 4. Food Gravitation Toward Snake
🎯 Behavior:
When you're close to food, it gets pulled in toward your head to simulate suction.

🛠️ Code for Gravitation:
Inside your game loop:

js
Copy
Edit
const suctionRadius = 100;
const suctionStrength = 0.2;

food.forEach(f => {
  const dx = snakeHead.x - f.x;
  const dy = snakeHead.y - f.y;
  const dist = Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);

  if (dist < suctionRadius) {
    f.x += dx / dist * suctionStrength;
    f.y += dy / dist * suctionStrength;
  }
});
This pulls nearby food gently toward your head.

🧠 Final Instructions for Replit AI:
“Reduce the snake's base speed by 50%. When boosting, increase speed by 50% of the base. During boost, drop small food every 5 frames at the tail with mass = 0.2, and remove 0.2 mass from the snake by reducing growthRemaining or popping segments. Set food types to spawn with 0.5 mass (small), 1 (medium), and 2 (big). Finally, make nearby food orbs (within 100px) gravitate slowly toward the snake's head for easier pickup.”
