âœ… GOAL:
Slight overlap between the balls (like in Slither.io).

Ensure the front (head) ball is always drawn on top of the body.

ðŸ§  Fix #1: Slight Overlap Between Balls
You can do this by reducing the spacing just below the segment diameter.

If you're using:

js
Copy
Edit
const SEGMENT_RADIUS = 10;      // So diameter is 20px
Then adjust:

js
Copy
Edit
const SEGMENT_SPACING = 18;     // ~10% overlap
This gives a 2px overlap, which creates the illusion of a smooth connected worm, without gaps.

Feel free to tweak this overlap more (e.g. SEGMENT_SPACING = 17) depending on what looks best.

ðŸ§  Fix #2: Draw Head Last (On Top)
Right now, you're looping through segments like this:

js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = visibleSegments.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
  drawSegment(visibleSegments[i]);
}
drawHead(visibleSegments[0]);
Thatâ€™s great â€” just make sure drawHead() comes after the body rendering to always appear on top.

âœ… Updated drawSnake() (Final Version):
js
Copy
Edit
function drawSnake() {
  // Draw tail to front (excluding head)
  for (let i = visibleSegments.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const seg = visibleSegments[i];

    const gradient = ctx.createRadialGradient(seg.x, seg.y, 0, seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS);
    gradient.addColorStop(0, "#ffbaba");
    gradient.addColorStop(1, "#d55400");

    ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
    ctx.fill();
  }

  // Draw head on top
  const headSeg = visibleSegments[0];
  const headGradient = ctx.createRadialGradient(headSeg.x, headSeg.y, 0, headSeg.x, headSeg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS);
  headGradient.addColorStop(0, "#ffffff");
  headGradient.addColorStop(1, "#d55400");

  ctx.fillStyle = headGradient;
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(headSeg.x, headSeg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fill();

  drawEyes(headSeg.x, headSeg.y, currentAngle);
}
âœ… Final Instructions for Replit AI:
Set SEGMENT_SPACING = 18 if SEGMENT_RADIUS = 10, to create a small overlap between body balls.

When drawing the snake:

Render the body segments first (from tail to just before the head).

Then draw the head segment last, so it always appears on top of the rest.

Ensure ctx.arc(...); ctx.fill() is used with a radial gradient for each segment.
