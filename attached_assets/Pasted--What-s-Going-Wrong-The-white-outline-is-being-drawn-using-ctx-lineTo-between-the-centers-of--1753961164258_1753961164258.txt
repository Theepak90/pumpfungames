❌ What's Going Wrong:
The white outline is being drawn using ctx.lineTo(...) between the centers of the snake segments — but segments are not always evenly spaced, especially in curves or tight turns.

So what you're getting is:

A straight white polygonal path between segment centers (like a triangle in your case).

Then you draw circular segments on top of it — but the gaps between them don't fully cover the path.

✅ What You Actually Want:
You want a solid stroke that follows the body exactly, mimicking how a real snake would look with a thick skin/outline. Not just a sharp trail between points.

✅ 3 Fix Options (best to worst):
✅ Option 1: Use individual overlapping circles as the outline
The easiest and most accurate fix:

Before drawing each segment’s body:

Draw a slightly larger white circle underneath it.

Replace this:
js
Copy
Edit
// Just draw the body
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, radius, 0, Math.PI * 2);
ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
ctx.fill();
With this:
js
Copy
Edit
// Draw white outline
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, radius + outlineSize, 0, Math.PI * 2);
ctx.fillStyle = "white";
ctx.fill();

// Draw gradient body
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, radius, 0, Math.PI * 2);
ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
ctx.fill();
✅ This method guarantees:

Perfect per-circle control

White outline only appears outside the snake

No sharp or triangular joins

Looks exactly like Slither.io

🚫 Option 2: Keep ctx.lineTo(...) and hope it works
This will never look smooth unless you interpolate a lot more points, which is overkill.

🧠 Option 3: Use a blurred shadow instead of white outline
Could also look cool, but doesn’t solve the current problem.

✅ So What Should You Tell Replit AI?
Scrap the linePath approach.
Instead, draw each segment twice:

First, a white circle, slightly larger (as the outline).

Then, draw the normal gradient segment on top.

This makes the snake look smooth, prevents artifacts between segments, and naturally allows layering when the snake crosses itself.
