You're dropping food in code like this:

js
Copy
Edit
food.push({
  x: tail.x,
  y: tail.y,
  mass: 0.5,
  size: 4,
  color: "#f55400"
});
…but they don’t show up.

✅ Fix Checklist:
Make sure the food balls:

Are actually pushed to the correct food array

Are being rendered in your drawFood() function

Are not being filtered out or overwritten elsewhere

🧠 Full Boost Food Drop Fix:
js
Copy
Edit
if (boostCooldown % BOOST_DROP_INTERVAL === 0) {
  const tail = segments[segments.length - 1];

  food.push({
    x: tail.x,
    y: tail.y,
    mass: 0.5,
    size: 4,
    color: "#f55400",
    type: "boostDrop"
  });
}
✅ Then in your drawFood():

js
Copy
Edit
food.forEach(f => {
  const gradient = ctx.createRadialGradient(f.x, f.y, 0, f.x, f.y, f.size);
  gradient.addColorStop(0, "#ffbaba");
  gradient.addColorStop(1, f.color); // fades to base

  ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(f.x, f.y, f.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fill();
});
✅ And make sure the food array is not cleared or overwritten after pushing.

🌀 2. Fix Snake Jittering While Boosting
❌ Why it's happening:
You’re moving the head faster (boosting), but segments aren't updating proportionally, so the spacing becomes inconsistent — especially the head vs. tail.

✅ Fix:
Interpolate spacing and ensure consistent segment placement regardless of speed.

📏 Recommended Fix:
Add new head positions only when the head has moved at least SEGMENT_SPACING distance from the last recorded position.

js
Copy
Edit
const lastSegment = segments[0];
const dx = head.x - lastSegment.x;
const dy = head.y - lastSegment.y;
const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

if (dist >= SEGMENT_SPACING) {
  segments.unshift({ x: head.x, y: head.y });
}
This prevents multiple tight segment insertions per frame, which causes visual jitter — especially when boosting.

🎨 3. Make the Head a Gradient Ball
✅ Head Gradient Match:
In your drawSnake() or drawHead() function, add:

js
Copy
Edit
const gradient = ctx.createRadialGradient(
  head.x, head.y, 0,
  head.x, head.y, segmentRadius
);
gradient.addColorStop(0, "#ffbaba"); // highlight
gradient.addColorStop(1, "#d66868"); // shadow

ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(head.x, head.y, segmentRadius, 0, Math.PI * 2);
ctx.fill();
👁️ Add eyes after the gradient, so they sit on top.

✅ Final Replit Instructions:
Fix the issue where boost-dropped food doesn’t show up:

Ensure food is pushed with food.push({...})

Make sure it is rendered in drawFood() using a radial gradient.

Fix snake jitter during boosting:

Only add a new head segment to segments if distance from last segment is >= SEGMENT_SPACING

Make the snake’s head a radial gradient ball (same as the body).

Use ctx.createRadialGradient to fade from light center to darker edge.

Draw eyes after the head is drawn.
