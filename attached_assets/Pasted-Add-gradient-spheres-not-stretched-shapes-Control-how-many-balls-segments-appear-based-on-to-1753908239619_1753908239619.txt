Add gradient spheres (not stretched shapes).

Control how many "balls" (segments) appear based on total mass.

Use shading from top-light → bottom-dark for realism.

✅ Step-by-Step: Slither.io Segment System
🎯 GOAL:
Each “ball” is a circular segment.

As you gain mass, you add another ball.

Each segment has a radial gradient to simulate 3D shading.

🧠 1. Link Mass to Visible Segments
Instead of blindly adding new segments every frame, track mass and only add a segment when you've gained enough.

js
Copy
Edit
const MASS_PER_SEGMENT = 1;
let totalMass = segments.length + growthRemaining;

// Each time totalMass crosses a new integer, add a new segment
🌀 2. Draw Segments as Gradient Circles
✅ Use ctx.createRadialGradient:
js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < segments.length; i++) {
  const seg = segments[i];

  const gradient = ctx.createRadialGradient(
    seg.x, seg.y, 0,
    seg.x, seg.y, segmentRadius
  );

  gradient.addColorStop(0, "#ffbaba");     // Light highlight
  gradient.addColorStop(1, "#d66868");     // Dark bottom

  ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, segmentRadius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fill();
}
💡 You can dynamically adjust the gradient colors based on the snake's skin.

📏 3. Segment Spacing: Fixed Distance, Not Frame-Based
Use a fixed distance between segments (segmentSpacing) and interpolate positions so that segments always stay spaced evenly behind the head — no matter how fast you move.

✏️ Segment Logic Summary:
Store segments = [{x, y}, {x, y}, ...]

Every frame:

Insert new head position at front if the head has moved >= segmentSpacing

Only draw as many visible segments as Math.floor(totalMass / MASS_PER_SEGMENT)

Remove excess segments beyond that count

🧠 Final Instructions for Replit AI:
"Update the snake's body so it's made of evenly spaced circular segments that each use a radial gradient (light on top, dark on bottom) to match Slither.io's 3D look. Tie visible segments to the snake’s total mass — only add a new body segment for every full unit of mass gained (e.g. 1 mass = 1 segment). Use ctx.createRadialGradient to give each ball its own shading. Ensure segments are drawn as evenly spaced circles, not stretched or connected lines."
