‚úÖ PROBLEM 1: Snake is not losing mass
‚ùå What‚Äôs wrong:
You‚Äôre probably controlling the visible segments based on total mass but not actually removing mass when boosting or idling.

‚úÖ Fix:
Ensure your growthRemaining is being reduced (or segments popped) when needed, and only render the snake based on Math.floor(totalMass / 3) (since 1 ball = 3 mass now).

üß† Suggested Fix Logic:
js
Copy
Edit
// Called every frame
if (isBoosting) {
  // Mass cost of boosting
  const boostMassLoss = 0.5 / framesPerDrop; // = 1.5 per sec if 3 balls/sec
  if (growthRemaining >= boostMassLoss) {
    growthRemaining -= boostMassLoss;
  } else if (segments.length > MIN_SEGMENTS) {
    segments.pop(); // shrink from tail
  }
}
Also update total mass:

js
Copy
Edit
const totalMass = segments.length * massPerSegment + growthRemaining;
‚úÖ PROBLEM 2: Balls Too Close Together / Snake Looks Like a Line
‚ùå Why it happens:
You‚Äôre drawing a circle every frame (or on tiny spacing), so they overlap heavily.

‚úÖ Fix: Space segments further apart & show 1 segment per 3 mass
This will create that visible "bead chain" look like in Slither.io.

üîß What to do:
1. Set spacing between balls:
js
Copy
Edit
const SEGMENT_SPACING = 8; // Increase to separate visually
2. Set visible segments based on mass:
js
Copy
Edit
const MASS_PER_BALL = 3;
const visibleBalls = Math.floor(totalMass / MASS_PER_BALL);
3. Populate and draw the snake based on this count:
js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < visibleBalls; i++) {
  const index = i * SEGMENT_SPACING;
  if (index < segments.length) {
    drawSegment(segments[index]);
  }
}
This gives you a spaced-out, round-looking snake that:

Adds a ball every 3 mass

Removes mass correctly during boost

Looks just like Slither.io

üß† Final Replit Instructions:
Space the snake‚Äôs body segments out by increasing the segment drawing gap (SEGMENT_SPACING = 8) so the body looks like individual beads.

Only render 1 visible segment per 3 mass (e.g. visibleSegments = Math.floor(totalMass / 3)).

Start the player with 30 mass, which equals 10 visible segments.

Ensure growthRemaining is correctly decreased when boosting, and remove tail segments if needed. Use:

js
Copy
Edit
const totalMass = segments.length + growthRemaining;
const visibleBalls = Math.floor(totalMass / 3);
