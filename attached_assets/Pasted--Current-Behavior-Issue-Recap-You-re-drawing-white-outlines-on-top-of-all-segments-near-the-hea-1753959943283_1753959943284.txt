🧠 Current Behavior (Issue Recap):
You're drawing white outlines on top of all segments near the head.

But now they’re overlapping earlier parts of the snake even when they shouldn’t — this makes the outline always “float” above the body, even when not overlapping itself.

✅ GOAL (Like Slither.io):
🟠 Body segments: always fully overlap older ones.

⚪ White outline:

Stays behind each segment normally

Only appears “on top” when a segment is visually above another (e.g., head overlapping the tail)

So the outline should only be visible on top if that part of the snake is on top — not globally.

✅ Solution — One-Pass Z-Ordered Rendering:
🎯 Key Trick:
Render each segment’s white outline just under its own orange body, in a single back-to-front loop (from tail to head).

This way:

All outlines go behind their own segment.

The top-most segments naturally appear above older parts (including outlines).

You don’t need any special highlight logic or dual-pass.

✅ Fix Instructions for Replit AI:
Replace your two-pass outline/body logic with a single loop that:

Draws each segment’s outline just before drawing the segment body.

Loop through all segments from tail to head.

This ensures outlines only appear under their own segments and never float incorrectly.

✅ Example Code:
js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < visibleSegments.length; i++) {
  const seg = visibleSegments[i];

  // Draw white outline behind segment
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS + 2, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fillStyle = "white";
  ctx.fill();

  // Draw gradient body
  const gradient = ctx.createRadialGradient(seg.x, seg.y, 0, seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS);
  gradient.addColorStop(0, "#ffbaba");
  gradient.addColorStop(1, "#d55400");

  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(seg.x, seg.y, SEGMENT_RADIUS, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
  ctx.fill();
}
✅ Note: You can draw the eyes and head details last, so the head always looks clean and sits on top.

🧠 Why This Works:
This uses natural z-ordering:

Each new segment appears above older ones.

Outlines only ever show behind the segment they belong to.

When snake overlaps itself, the correct segments (and their outlines) appear on top.

✅ Summary for Replit AI:
Draw each snake segment from tail to head in a single loop.

Within that loop, draw:

The segment’s white outline (radius + 2)

Then the colored segment body

This prevents outlines from floating above other segments, and naturally supports correct overlapping visuals like Slither.io.
