✅ New Money System (Post-Death Green Square Drops)
🧠 Core Logic:
💰 Every snake has a money value (starts at $1.00)

🪦 On death: green squares drop around body path

💵 Each green square = $0.20

🍴 When picked up → increases the money of the collector

❌ Killing someone no longer gives instant money

✅ 1. Drop Money Squares on Death
In your server or game logic, update the onDeath() function:

js
Copy
Edit
function handleSnakeDeath(snake) {
  const dropCount = Math.floor(snake.money / 0.2); // $0.20 chunks

  for (let i = 0; i < dropCount; i++) {
    const seg = snake.segments[Math.floor(i / dropCount * snake.segments.length)];

    spawnMoneyFood({
      x: seg.x + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
      y: seg.y + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
      value: 0.2,
      type: 'money',
    });
  }

  // Reset money
  snake.money = 0;
}
✅ 2. Make Green Squares Visible & Valuable
When rendering these on canvas:

js
Copy
Edit
if (food.type === 'money') {
  ctx.fillStyle = '#00ff00'; // green square
  ctx.fillRect(food.x - 5, food.y - 5, 10, 10); // 10x10 square
}
Or if using an image, draw it instead of a square.

✅ 3. Pickup Money Squares to Gain Money
In your food pickup logic:

js
Copy
Edit
if (food.type === 'money') {
  snake.money += food.value; // typically 0.2
}
Make sure this is the only place money is increased now.

✅ 4. Disable Kill-Based Money Rewards
Find wherever money is currently added when killing someone, and remove it:

js
Copy
Edit
// Remove this if it exists:
snake.money += 1.00; // or based on % of killed player’s mass
✅ Optional Enhancements
Add a floating $+0.20 text when picking up money

Animate green square rotation or glow

Cap max money if needed

✅ What to Tell Replit AI
Replace the money system:

On player death, drop green square foods worth $0.20 each (number based on their current money)

Each square should spawn along the body trail or in a random cluster around it

Players earn money only by collecting those green squares

Do not give money for kills anymore

Green squares should be styled clearly (e.g., 10x10 bright green squares)

Picking up one increases the player’s money stat
