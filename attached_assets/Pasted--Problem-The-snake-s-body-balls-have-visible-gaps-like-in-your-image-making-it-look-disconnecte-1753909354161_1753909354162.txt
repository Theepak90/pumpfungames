❌ Problem:
The snake's body balls have visible gaps (like in your image), making it look disconnected.

✅ Solution:
Make sure the spacing between segments is equal to or slightly less than the segment diameter.

🧠 What to Do:
Let’s say your segmentRadius = 10, so diameter = 20.

Set:

js
Copy
Edit
const SEGMENT_SPACING = 18; // slightly overlap for smoothness
Then in your segment placement logic:

js
Copy
Edit
// Only add new segment if distance from last is >= SEGMENT_SPACING
const dx = head.x - segments[0].x;
const dy = head.y - segments[0].y;
const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

if (dist >= SEGMENT_SPACING) {
  segments.unshift({ x: head.x, y: head.y });
}
You can even tweak SEGMENT_SPACING = 19 for minimal overlap or full contact.

🍞 2. Fix: Boost-Dropped Food Falls Too Far Behind
❌ Problem:
You’re dropping the food at the last body segment, which may be quite far from the head, especially during boost speed.

✅ Solution:
Instead, drop food a small distance behind the head, along the snake’s current direction.

🧠 How to Fix It:
Use the snake’s currentAngle (already used for movement) to offset backward slightly:

js
Copy
Edit
const dropDistance = 20; // pixels behind head
const dropX = head.x - Math.cos(currentAngle) * dropDistance;
const dropY = head.y - Math.sin(currentAngle) * dropDistance;

food.push({
  x: dropX,
  y: dropY,
  mass: 0.5,
  size: 4,
  color: "#f55400",
  type: "boostDrop"
});
This drops food consistently just behind the head, giving a natural trail like in Slither.io.

✅ Final Instructions for Replit AI:
Fix the visible gaps between snake segments:

Set SEGMENT_SPACING to slightly less than the segment diameter (e.g. 18 if radius is 10).

Only add new segments when the head has moved >= SEGMENT_SPACING.

Fix boost-dropped food placement:

Drop food just behind the snake's head, not at the tail.

Use currentAngle to offset backward:

js
Copy
Edit
const dropX = head.x - Math.cos(currentAngle) * 20;
const dropY = head.y - Math.sin(currentAngle) * 20;
