üß† Goal: Realistic Bot Movement
Bots should behave like real players:

Wander smoothly, not spin in circles

Chase nearby food

Avoid other snakes

Occasionally boost or roam

Drop mass on death

üß© 1. Bot States: Simulated Behavior
Each bot has a behavior state like:

State	What It Does
Wander	Roams randomly in open space
Food Hunt	Seeks and eats nearby food
Avoid	Turns away from close players or danger
Aggro (optional)	Follows smaller players (like predators)
Circle	Occasionally arcs in loops (like camping food)

Bots should switch states based on what's around them.

üîÅ 2. Smooth, Player-Like Turning
Update bot angle using smooth turning:

js
Copy
Edit
bot.angle += (targetAngle - bot.angle) * turnSpeed;
Where:

turnSpeed is something like 0.1 (slow and smooth)

Prevents snapping or spinning

Then update position:

js
Copy
Edit
bot.x += Math.cos(bot.angle) * bot.speed;
bot.y += Math.sin(bot.angle) * bot.speed;
‚úÖ Smooth drifting, like players in Slither.io.

ü•£ 3. Food Attraction
When in "Food Hunt":

Scan for the nearest visible food

Lock onto it if within radius (e.g. 400px)

Move toward it

js
Copy
Edit
function findClosestFood(bot, foodList) {
  let closest = null;
  let minDist = Infinity;
  for (const food of foodList) {
    const dx = food.x - bot.x;
    const dy = food.y - bot.y;
    const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    if (dist < minDist) {
      closest = food;
      minDist = dist;
    }
  }
  return closest;
}
Then set targetAngle = angleTo(closestFood).

üß® 4. Collision Avoidance
If another snake is:

In front of the bot

And close (within ~150px)

Then switch to Avoid state:

Calculate a turn-away angle

Temporarily stop chasing food

js
Copy
Edit
function avoidDanger(bot, snakes) {
  for (const snake of snakes) {
    if (snake === bot) continue;
    const dx = snake.x - bot.x;
    const dy = snake.y - bot.y;
    const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    if (dist < 150) {
      bot.targetAngle = angleAwayFrom(dx, dy);
      bot.state = "Avoid";
      return;
    }
  }
}
üîÑ 5. Wandering
When no food or danger:

Every 2‚Äì4 seconds, pick a new random angle

Slowly turn toward it

js
Copy
Edit
if (Date.now() - bot.lastWanderTime > 2500) {
  bot.wanderAngle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
  bot.lastWanderTime = Date.now();
}
bot.angle += (bot.wanderAngle - bot.angle) * 0.02;
‚úÖ Creates natural-looking roaming.

üöÄ 6. Boost Logic
Bots should occasionally boost when:

Near food

Fleeing another player

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
if (bot.state === "FoodHunt" && Math.random() < 0.01) {
  bot.isBoosting = true;
  bot.boostTime = Date.now();
}

if (bot.isBoosting && Date.now() - bot.boostTime > 1000) {
  bot.isBoosting = false;
}
Adjust speed when isBoosting is true.

üíÄ 7. Death Drop
When a bot dies:

Drop mass (orange balls)

Drop money crates if applicable

Respawn after delay

Spread mass along previous segments with slight randomness.

üß† 8. Behavior Switching
Use a simple state machine:

js
Copy
Edit
switch (bot.state) {
  case "Wander":
    wander();
    if (seeFoodNearby()) bot.state = "FoodHunt";
    break;
  case "FoodHunt":
    chaseFood();
    if (tooCloseToSnake()) bot.state = "Avoid";
    break;
  case "Avoid":
    runAway();
    if (safeNow()) bot.state = "Wander";
    break;
}
‚úÖ Adds variety and realism.

‚úÖ What to Tell Replit AI (Copy This)
Make the bots behave like real Slither.io players:

Each bot should have a state like Wander, FoodHunt, or Avoid

In Wander, pick a new random angle every few seconds and slowly turn toward it

In FoodHunt, chase the nearest food within 400px by setting angle toward it

In Avoid, if another snake is within 150px, turn away from it

Boost occasionally if chasing food or avoiding players

Smooth the turning using angle interpolation:

js
Copy
Edit
bot.angle += (targetAngle - bot.angle) * 0.1;
Update position each frame with:

js
Copy
Edit
bot.x += Math.cos(bot.angle) * bot.speed;
bot.y += Math.sin(bot.angle) * bot.speed;
Do not make bots spin randomly or tightly

When a bot dies, drop mass along its segments like a player
