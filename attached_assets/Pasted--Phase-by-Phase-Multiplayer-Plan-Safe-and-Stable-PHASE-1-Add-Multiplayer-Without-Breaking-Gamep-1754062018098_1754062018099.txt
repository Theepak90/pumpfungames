✅ ️Phase-by-Phase Multiplayer Plan (Safe and Stable)
PHASE 1: Add Multiplayer Without Breaking Gameplay
The local game should run exactly like it already does even if:

The server isn’t available

Multiplayer isn't connected

Key Rule: Local snake rendering, movement, growth, food, boosting, and money must always work independently.

✅ Tasks for Replit:

1. Wrap all WebSocket logic inside a try/catch or feature flag:
   Only connect to the server if multiplayer mode is active.

2. Add multiplayer as an *optional layer*:
   - My snake: local logic
   - Other players: update from WebSocket

3. Don't change anything in local gameplay (movement, food, collisions, growth, camera, money).
PHASE 2: Server Handles ONLY Other Players (at First)
Keep your snake fully local — the server only sends info about other players.

✅ Server responsibilities:
Accept connections and store each player’s snake data (position, angle, segments, mass)

Broadcast all player snakes every 50–100ms to everyone

✅ Client responsibilities:
Send only position, angle, segments, and boosting

Render other players' snakes from server data

Do NOT let the server control my snake’s movement or food yet.
PHASE 3: Add Food Sync Carefully
Local snake still eats food instantly, but now it tells the server.

✅ New logic:
When I eat food:

Remove it locally

Send a message to server: “I ate food ID #123”

Server verifies and tells all other clients to also remove that food

⚠️ Be careful:

Never delay local food eating just to wait for the server.
PHASE 4: Add Real Deaths and Respawns
Death is still handled locally at first. Once solid, the server gets involved.

✅ Safe order:
Handle death when snake hits another (locally)

Then notify the server to:

Remove dead snake

Drop food

Broadcast new food

Let player respawn

PHASE 5: Add Regions and Scaling
After 2-player testing works perfectly, then add:

Region detection (Europe vs US)

Server auto-balancing (max 5 players per instance)

🔁 What to Tell Replit AI
Rebuild multiplayer safely by following these steps:

✅ Phase 1: Leave all core gameplay untouched — movement, growth, food, death, money, boosting should all remain local
✅ Phase 2: Add WebSocket connection to send/receive only other player snakes
✅ Phase 3: Send food pickups to server for sync, but keep local food eating immediate
✅ Phase 4: Handle deaths locally, then notify server for food drops and respawn
✅ Phase 5: Add regional servers and auto-scaling later

Only add multiplayer as a layer on top, never inside local game logic.
